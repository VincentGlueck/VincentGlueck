**Overview**

Hi, Iâ€™m @VincentGlueck , a.k.a **Martin** (Helmut) **Lange**, VincGlueck (__Nintendo__), VincentGlueck(__XBox live__), former Whistling Willi (ww)

**What I do or do not**

In my spare time I sometimes take focus on some Android related (small) project.

Will switch to Kotlin as it looks quite nice to me - after years of Java (Job deal with Java, Spring boot etc, too).
Dunno, my current project - of course - started the old-fashioned-way: Java ;-)

**Bio**

Starting on ZX-81, learing Zilog Assembler, 6502 Assembler language/codes, I went to PC, later on to Mobile development.
I then studied computer science and completed successfully -> real life started.

**Finally met my wife**

**History**

I'm really that old.

               CLD
               int     3
               PUSH    BP
               MOV     BP,SP
               PUSH    DS
               MOV     CS:OLDSS,SS
               MOV     CS:OLDSP,SP
               CALL    PARAMETER
               PUSH    CS
               PUSH    CS
               POP     DS
               POP     ES
               CLI

**Finally**

Enjoy. This may be updated.
